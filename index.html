                During this project, I set up Kubernetes, designed
                microservices, and worked in multiple great teams trying to
                ensure quality for newly developed cars. If you have any

                When this project started, it was a pioneer product focusing on

                We also developed an AI chatbot with the capability to support

              <p>
                After some time, I switched to working on the Android Platform,
                with work ranging from writing rules for SELinux to getting
                Google Assistant to work before it was officially supported.

                This project was a browser-based ship simulator. It rendered

                One of the uses for this software was to give a ship captain a
                chance to simulate docking in a new port - and have the ability
                to add a multitude of variables.
